    <h2><a href="/posts/2021-roadmap/">2021 Paketo Buildpacks Roadmap</a></h2>
    Weâ€™re not even at the one year anniversary of the Paketo Buildpacks launch, but weâ€™ve already got so much to celebrate ðŸŽ‰. 2020 was a busy year for the Paketo Buildpacks core development team. Looking back on the last year, a few highlights stand out:
 Establishing our project governance and RFC process Moving all project tooling to Github-based workflows Building out a foundational set of buildpacks for some of the most popular languages including Java, Node.

    <h2><a href="/posts/paketo-buildpacks-hot-topic-at-cf-summit/">Paketo Buildpacks Hot Topic at Cloud Foundry Summit</a></h2>
    Paketo Buildpacks were a hot topic at the recently concluded Cloud Foundry Summit, the first virtual Summit run by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The Summit featured project updates, particularly in the Kubernetes space, including a talk on Paketo Buildpacks. Dan Thornton, an engineer contributing to the Paketo Buildpacks project, maintained that they are the ideal tool for transforming app source code into container images.
So, we wanted to share Danâ€™s talk here and dive into a Q&amp;A of all of the questions we didnâ€™t get to answer during this session.

    Iâ€™m excited to announce the launch of Paketo Buildpacks, a collection of Cloud Native Buildpacks for the most popular languages and frameworks. Paketo Buildpacks make it easy for you to build and patch containerized apps so that you can spend all your time on the thing that matters the mostâ€¦ developing great software.
First offâ€¦ what are Paketo Buildpacks, and why would I use them?  Buildpacks provide a higher-level abstraction for building apps
