    Photo by Jon Flobrant on Unsplash
  Sharing what we&rsquo;ve learned The Paketo Buildpacks Team has been developing our Cloud Native Buildpacks for the better part of 2 years now. In the process, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what works well and what doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve made mistakes and interated toward solutions that are more flexible, easier to maintain, and provide better experiences for our users. In the process, we&rsquo;ve developed a set of guidelines ‚Äì a philosophy, maybe ‚Äì for how we think about developing buildpacks.

    <h2><a href="/posts/java-rearchitecture/">Java Buildpack Support and Debug Enhancements</a></h2>
    I‚Äôm pleased to announce that the Paketo Java Buildpack has been enhanced to make it even easier to analyze and debug your JVM based applications. A host of features have been added or integrated in the form of environment variable flags, and some features which previously required image rebuilds can now simply be toggled at runtime. This post will outline how to both configure the JVM itself and make use of the following features:

    <h2><a href="/posts/building-a-cloud-native-buildpack-isnt-as-hard-as-you-think/">Building a Cloud Native Buildpack Isn‚Äôt as Hard as You Think</a></h2>
    Maybe you‚Äôve heard that many companies today are transitioning to, or have already transitioned to, a container-based platform like Kubernetes. With this movement comes the need to containerize your applications, new and old. Buildpacks provide a seamless mechanism for doing that without Dockerfiles. Paketo Buildpacks is a community-driven project that provides Cloud Native Buildpacks implementations for the most popular languages.
Buildpacks provide great out-of-box support for many languages, but what if you need a buildpack that doesn‚Äôt exist yet?

    On behalf of the Paketo contributors, I&rsquo;m pleased to unveil the new and improved .NET Core Buildpack! With the release of Paketo .NET Core Buildpack 0.1.0, you‚Äôll enjoy a host of new features and improvements that will make containerizing your .NET apps a breeze. üçÉ
With the new buildpack, you can:
 Build .NET 5 apps Build your app from source code, from a framework-dependent deployment (FDD), from a framework-dependent executable (FDE), or from a self-contained deployment Build Visual Basic apps Have source code removed from final app image.
